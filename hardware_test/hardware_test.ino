This file can be used to test the hardware of the firefly if the soldering process is done.
If the Arduino IDE is available the Serial monitor can be opend to get the the information of the hardware. If the Arduino IDE is not available
just load the program and watch the visible LED. It blinks if the potentiometer or the switches are changed or of a flash is received by the receiver.

To test the hardware just switch the switches or turn the potentiometer and observe the LED or the Serial monitor.
The IR-receivers can be testet with any remote control. 

Don't make the changes to fast!!!
