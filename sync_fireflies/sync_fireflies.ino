This is the main file that simulates the virtual firefly. 
Because of the three way switch used on the shield up to 8 different variations or mechanisms can be programmed.
Right now this code contains 3 different synchronization mechanisms. The models are the mathematical mode Renato E. Mirollo and Steven H. Strogtz
used in their paper "Synchronization of Pulse-Coupled Biological Oszillators" and the phase-advance synchronization model
and phase-delay synchronization model proposed from John Buck.

	The three pin Dil switch is attached to the Pins PD2 (Digital Pin 2), PD3 (Digital Pin 3) and PD4 (Digital Pin 4)

	The pins have to be somehow be pulled up or pulled down to get a defined digital state. Therefor the internal pull-ups are used to save some place.
	They are activated for the whole PORD D because that makes it much easier later to ask for the Switch state.

	    if x is bigger than x_reset than must a flash occur dependent on which mode is activ. The swich states are counted through in binary.
	    So if no switch is on the PIND-register lokks like that: PIND = 0b00011100 (that is state "0" and corresponds to the model from Mirollo and Strogatz)
	    If the first switch is on it looks like this: PIND = 0b00011000 (that is state "1" and that corresponds to the phase advance mechanism)
	    And so on: PIND = 0b00010100 (state "2" correspond to the phase delay mechanism)
	    PIND = 0b00010000 (state "3")
	    PIND = 0b00001100 (state "4")
	    PIND = 0b00001000 (state "5")
	    PIND = 0b00000100 (state "6")
	    PIND = 0b00000000 (state "7")

	    So 5 more mechanisms can be added to that model.
